    * Store amount of digits in label number and hand receipt in ini
    * Pop up at first run to set digit amounts, fill with defaults 2 and 5, have as GUI with updating example (i.e. they enter "3" and display shows: Preview: disablededit[001] 
    * Preferences:
        - [ ] Delete old Archives
            {disabled}Archive file limit: [Value in ini]
        - Label Digits
	* Make updating listbox into sub with -redraw at beginning and +redraw at end
	* Put Order Number at top of ListView instead of "Selected:"
	- In Full Inventory, hide empty Columns and Hide QTY if no QI
	? Make "Refresh Inventory" option?

		- To Show: popup gui with checkboxes unchecked (like the normal Export gui),
	- Add leading Zero to label (can also be used for Order Numbers): SubStr("0" . A_Index,-1,2)
	- Make LabelAdvance() a function
	- store labels in ini as follows:
		 	[Labels]
			<Customer>=<HighestNumber>
	- if any edits made to Label, update ini (don't change Highest if not Highest!)
	- make EditCell recognize Label column and display edit gui that breaks up over as: edt[LabelName]-edt[LabelNumber]
	    -   Detect if label already exists? Maybe prompt: 
	                                            -|"Label Number already exists:"
	                                             |"(Cancel will revert change you just made)"
	                                             |   o Try Again
	                                             |   o Change Duplicate

	- Msg on bottom saying if label# left blank "-" will be removed
	- Change HR Number field to say Order#:00000
	- you can store numbers with leading zeros in ini, but they will lose the zeros when incremented normally (i.e. x += 1)
	    - increment numbers with leading zeros: var := SubStr("[zeros]" . var + 1, -1, [digitcount])
	        - zeros (formatted "00", "000", "0000" and so on) can be as many as you want
	        - digitcount contains how many you want the total number to be
