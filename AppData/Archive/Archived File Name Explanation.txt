Archived filenames look like this:
Inventory.20160603.234505.Startup.csv
Inventory.20160603.234506.Changed.csv

Heres what it means:
The numbers are a time stamp that is exactly when backup was made, it breaks down as below

Inventory.	2016	06	03.	23	45	05	
Inventory.	2016	06	03.	23	45	06	
		Year	Month	Day	Hour	Minute	Second

After that is Why it was automatically backed up:
.Startup.csv
.Changed.csv

If this archive folder ever contains more than 100 backups, the oldest files will automatically be purged to keep the total file count at 100.

If you want to change that value (keep more or less):
 - Open the info.ini in the folder above (\G6 Mission Inventory\AppData\info.ini)
 - Change the number value under [Archived Records to Keep]

One small note on changing the value: the Inventory.csv used for demonstration had 840 Lines and was 51KB, when the folder had 100 of them, the folder's size was 5.08 MB. 
Use that information as you will.
